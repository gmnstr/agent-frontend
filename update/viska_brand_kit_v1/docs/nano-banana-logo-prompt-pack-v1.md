# Nano Banana Logo Prompt Pack v1

Short brief: minimal, Nordic, cryptographic‑whisper aesthetic for a dark professional UI. Primary mark is abstract (ledger‑link or whisper‑wave), monochrome first, flat vector look.

## 1) Primary symbol mark (monochrome)
[See full prompt in your chat history; copied here verbatim compatible with Nano Banana.]
Create an image of a minimal monochrome vector logo mark that embodies “silent intelligence” and “secured reasoning.”
Subject: a single abstract symbol using 1–2 simple geometric shapes (circle, square, arc) with negative space forming either a subtle chain/ledger link or a soft “whisper wave.”
Style: Nordic minimalism, high precision, flat 2D, solid fills, razor‑sharp edges, no texture.
Constraints: no text, no gradients, no 3D, no bevel, no glow, no drop shadows, no literal locks/keys/fingerprints/shields.
Palette: white (or very light gray) mark on a dark slate background (#0E1116). Provide a second variant inverted (dark mark on white).
Framing: centered, generous padding; export as a clean logo render suitable for vector tracing.

## 2) Wordmark (placeholder name)
Create an image of a clean sans‑serif wordmark for [BRAND].
Subject: geometric grotesk letterforms with calm proportions (Inter/SF‑like), optical kerning tuned for small sizes.
Custom cue: tiny notch / ledger‑link detail in the ‘ka’ join.
Constraints: flat 1‑color, no gradients/effects/outlines. Background: #0E1116 and a light version.
Deliver: straight wordmark (no slogan), centered, ample clearspace.

## 3) Horizontal lockup (symbol + wordmark)
Create an image of a horizontal brand lockup using the symbol from (1) and wordmark from (2). Symbol left, wordmark right; clearspace = cap height; baseline aligned.
Constraints: flat 1‑color; dark‑mode and light‑mode variants.

## 4) Badge / app icon
Square app icon using the abstract symbol. Rounded rect container (~24% radius), generous padding, 1‑color, no effects. Dark and light versions.

## 5) Hero header for the portal (16:9)
16:9 hero header where the symbol replaces the headline. Very subtle background field around #0E1116. No 3D, no flares. Symbol dominant.
